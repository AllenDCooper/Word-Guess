The game will set up a round.

The round will:
pick a random word
create word blanks

2) When a user press a letter key, it will update the round.

Updating the round means:
seeing if it was a correct guess
reducing guessesLeft,
displaying wrong guesses,
filling in correct guesses.
check to see if user has won or if user has lost
If user has lost or won, need to end the round, update wins and losses, and start new round
